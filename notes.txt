Variable naming convention --> snake_case
.find() return -1 vs .index() throws ValueErrorException {if substring not found}
*Strings are immutable - cannot be changed once created --> TypeError thrown if try to reassign a character in a string. However a variable can be reassigned to a new string

Python relies on indentation to define code blocks = (defined with ':'). IndentationError thrown + code execution stops if no indented block found after final colon (4 spaces - recommened/preferred, interpreters can recognize tab indentation)
*Whitespace matters in Python - not like other languages were it is used for readability only. Indentation is essential for code to run properly/define code blocks
