# STR
## .isalpha() - returns True if all characters in string are alphabetic
## .find() return -1 vs .index() throws ValueErrorException {if substring not found}
## str.maketrans() - built-in string method --> creates translation table (dict as param); can be used to replace chars in a string
Then use string.translate(translation_table) to apply the translation
## *Strings are immutable - cannot be changed once created --> TypeError thrown if try to reassign a character in a string. However a variable can be reassigned to a new string
## f'Interpolate values into {variable} using f-string' 
## r'raw string - ignores escape characters in string' used mainly for regex patterns (eg. instead of '[0-9]' use r'\d')
--> can be used in combination < fr'f-string with raw string' >
## slice[start:stop:step]
example - reverse slice[start:stop:step][::-1] or use negative indexes
## .split(delimiter): Splits the string into a list of substrings at each occurrence of the delimiter.

#LIST
## my_list.append(?) - adds element to end of list
## *'pass' keyword in function body - used as a placeholder for future code to be added - no effect on code but > prevents errors from no code block/incomplete code.

## .float() - converts *!String or int number --> returns floating point number [ValueError if string is not a number]


## Python relies on indentation to define code blocks = (defined with ':'). IndentationError thrown + code execution stops if no indented block found after final colon (4 spaces - recommened/preferred, interpreters can recognize tab indentation)
## Python uses a two-pass parse process. In the first pass, it creates definitions for functions and variables. In the second pass, it executes the code.

# '__name__' variable to determine if scripot being run as the main program or being imported as a module (code written in another file) --> if == '__main__' then script is being run as main program
	However, when a Python file is imported as a module, __name__ is set to the name of that module (i.e., the filename without the .py extension).
	Ensures that the main() function (or any code within this block) is only executed when the script is run directly. This is useful when you have code (like tests or demonstrations of functionality) that you only want to run when executing the script directly, and not when importing the module.
TLDR - if script imported as module, __name__ != '__main__' --> main() function not executed

## *Whitespace matters in Python - not like other languages were it is used for readability only. Indentation is essential for code to run properly/define code blocks

# TUTORIAL 2 -- Luhn Algorithm
### formula to validate variery of identification numbers
### Widely used for error-checking in various apps (eg. credit card numbers)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm
1.From the right to left, double the value of every second digit; if the product is greater than 9, sum the digits of the products (eg. 6*2=12 > 9...sum = 1+2=3)
	[use integer division {// 10} to get first digit and modulo {% 10} to get second digit] 
2.Take the sum of all the digits.
3.If the sum of all the digits is a multiple of 10, then the number is valid; else it is not valid.


# Tutorial 3: Create Expense Tracker - Lambda Function, lists + methods, dicts, while loops 
## Lambda functions are short anonymouse functions (eg. lambda x: x+1) (JS Arrow functions)
eg.test = lambda x: x * 2 ---> print(sum(map(test, [2, 3, 5, 8])))

# Tutorial 4: List Comprehension - construct new list from iterable types (lists, tuples, strings) +Build str Case Format Converter
## List comprehensions in Python are a concise way to construct a list without using loops or the .append() method. Apart from being briefer, list comprehensions often run faster.

# Tutorial 5: Regular Expressions - Build Password Generator
## 'random' module contains a pseudo-random number generator. 
****IMPORTANT random algo is predicatable, not truly random so not suitable for cryptographic purposes
### 'secrets' module - most secure source of !*OS provided*! randomness
### random.random() - returns a floating point number between 0.0 (inclusive) and 1.0 (exclusive)
### random.choice(?) - takes a sequence and returns a random item of the sequence
### use 'secrets' module for cryptographically secure random number generator
### secrets.choice(?) - takes a sequence and returns a random item of the sequence

# 're' module - provides support for regular expressions (regex) in Python
--> pattern = re.compile() - compiles a regex pattern into a regex object that can be used by other re methods.
----> pattern.search(?) - searches for a regex pattern within a string and returns the first match
	  re.search(pattern, ?)

# (*args) specifies the number of non-keyworded arguments that can be passed and the operations that can be performed on the function in Python, whereas (**kwargs) is a variable number of keyworded arguments that can be passed to a function that can perform dictionary operations
--> args is a tuple, kwargs is a dictionary
--> iterate args, dictionary methods kwargs
--> args - positional arguments, kwargs - keyword arguments (K:V pairs)

# (Tuples) vs [Lists] - immutable. 

# Tutorial 6: Algorithm Desgin - Shortest Path Algo
*Access Python dict with dict_name[key] or dict_name.get(key) - returns None if key not found
### Graph Data Structure focus on relationships between Nodes/elements (eg. objects, entities, points in space etc.) connected together by Edges
	Weighted graphs -->  edges are assigned a weight (eg. distance/time/quantitive-value between two points)
